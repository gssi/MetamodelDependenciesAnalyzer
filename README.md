# Metamodel Dependencies Analyzer 
<h4>This repository contains the code developed for the dependencies analysis of metamodels</h4>

<p>The developed script is able to analyse a repository of Ecore models, given as input folder, and generate a graph-based representation of the metamodels</p>
<p> In this representation the edges are the dependencies among the Ecore models, e.g., a reference type defined in another Ecore Models. </p>
This tool has been used in Edelta to support the parallel evolution of metamodels.
<p>We report here the image of the dependencies-graph generated from the dataset published at [1]</p>
